# Thinkful_Capstone_3
For my final Capstone with Thinkful, I analyzed delivery bakery sales data in Python.
  This data is for a small bakery in **Dongmyeon, S. Korea** that started offering delivery on a third-party platform called Beamin in July 2019 and saw sales spike during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

  This dataset spans 11 months, starting in July 2019 and ending in May 2020, and consists of two CSV files: the first one keeps up with product quantity sold, order time and day, and order totals. The other file just contains all menu items and their corresponding prices.

  Itâ€™s important to note that the bakery is closed on Tuesday.


 The prices shown are in South Korean won, which converts to ~ .00082 USD. In simpler terms, the prices shown are standard for a bakery, running between 1500 for jam and 5000 won for cheesecake, which is between 1 and 4 USD, for reference.

This [dataset](https://https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hosubjeong/bakery-sales) is from Kaggle.
 
This analysis was done in [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LGinMhg8_ykUVYab15Gwu-s-zGnvkki4?usp=sharing)
